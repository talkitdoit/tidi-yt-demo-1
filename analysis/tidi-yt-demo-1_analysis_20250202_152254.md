## Analysis

Let's analyze the provided Pulumi Go code for best practices and potential issues.

### Best Practices
1. **Configuration Management**: The code uses Pulumi's configuration management to set default values for the `path`, `indexDocument`, and `errorDocument` variables. This is a good practice as it allows for flexibility and customization without changing the code.
2. **Error Handling**: The code checks for errors after each resource creation and returns the error if one occurs. This ensures that any issues are caught early and can be addressed.
3. **Resource Group Creation**: A resource group is created to manage all the resources. This is a good practice as it helps in organizing and managing resources efficiently.
4. **Static Website Configuration**: The storage account is configured as a static website, which is a common use case for hosting static content.
5. **CDN Integration**: The code integrates a CDN to distribute and cache the website, which improves performance and reliability.
6. **Exporting Outputs**: The code exports the URLs and hostnames of the storage account and CDN endpoint, which is useful for further automation or manual inspection.

### Potential Issues
1. **Hardcoded Values**: The `path`, `indexDocument`, and `errorDocument` variables have default hardcoded values. While these can be overridden via configuration, it would be better to document these defaults clearly or provide more descriptive variable names.
2. **HTTP Not Allowed**: The CDN endpoint is configured to disallow HTTP (`IsHttpAllowed: pulumi.Bool(false)`). While this is a good security practice, it should be documented to avoid confusion.
3. **Content Types to Compress**: The list of content types to compress is hardcoded. It might be beneficial to make this configurable.
4. **Resource Naming**: The resource names (`resource-group`, `account`, `website`, `synced-folder`, `profile`, `endpoint`) are generic. Using more descriptive names can help in identifying resources easily, especially in larger projects.
5. **Unused Imports**: The import `net/url` is used only once for parsing the URL. Consider if this can be simplified or if the import is necessary.
6. **Error Handling in ApplyT**: The `ApplyT` function for `originHostname` includes error handling, but it might be better to handle this error more gracefully or log it for debugging purposes.

Overall, the code follows good practices for infrastructure as code with Pulumi. Addressing the potential issues mentioned can further improve the code's readability, maintainability, and flexibility.
